### Read

â†’ Creon Levit keeps a list of a treasure trove of profound books [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ScT4mRP03zJVAYtKk3JQ1ty456P5cXJbbyzV_mWvT-c/edit) The list spans the fields of Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology, History, and Politics, Engineering, Computer Science, Literature, and Biographies

* [Rejecting the Ideal of Value-Free Science ](http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/3330/douglas-rejectingvaluefreeideal.pdf)- Heather Douglas. Is science value-free? Should it be?

* [On the very idea of a conceptual scheme](https://www2.southeastern.edu/Academics/Faculty/jbell/conceptualscheme.pdf) - Donald Davidson. Against conceptual relativism. Not an easy read but worth it. I recommend reading Tarski's Theory of truth, too.

* [Scale: The Universal Laws of Growth, Innovation, Scale](https://www.amazon.com/Scale-Universal-Innovation-Sustainability-Organisms/dp/1594205582)  - book by Geoffrey West. On fractal-like scaling laws that govern anything from cells (sublinear scaling laws)  to cities (superlinear scaling laws), and what this means for aging and innovation.

* [What if?](http://1.droppdf.com/files/rlXDU/what-if-randall-munroe.pdf): - e-book by Randall Munroe. Designer of XKCD  web comics offers serious scientific answers to absurd hypothetical questions

* [Flatland ](http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/Flatland/)- e-book by Edwin A. Abott Abott. Square has adventures in Spaceland (three dimensions), Lineland (one dimension) and Pointland (no dimensions) and ultimately entertains thoughts of visiting a land of four dimensions. Fictional introduction to the concept of the multiple dimensions of space

* [Anti-fragile](https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680) - Nassim Taleb. stands uncertainty on its head, making it desirable, even necessary, and proposes that things be built in an antifragile manner. The antifragile is beyond the resilient or robust. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better and better.

### Listen & Watch 

* [Kurz Gesagt ](https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt)- Youtube channel. Short science movies with the focus on optimistic nihilism

* [The Transformative Power of Energy & Information](https://vimeo.com/86049298) - lecture by David Krakauer. Discusses the roles of energy and information in 21st century biology

### Do

* [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/about/) -  A blog about science, medicine, philosophy, politics, and futurism by Scott Alexander.

* [Santa Fe Institute ](https://www.santafe.edu/)- The world headquarters for complexity science. As an independent, nonprofit research center, we are searching for order in the complexity of evolving world. 

* [The Institute for Advanced Studies](https://www.ias.edu/welcome) - Princeton. Founding Director [Abraham Flexner](https://www.ias.edu/scholars/flexner) believed that if the Institute "eschews the chase for the useful, the minds of its scholars will be liberated, they will be free to take advantage of surprises, and someday an unexpected discovery, apparently leading nowhere, will be found to be an indispensable link in a long and complex chain that may open new worlds in theory and practice."
