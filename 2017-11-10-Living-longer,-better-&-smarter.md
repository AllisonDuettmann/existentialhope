# Longevity

*"Stories about aging have traditionally focused on the need for graceful accommodation. The recommended solution to diminishing vigor and impending death was resignation coupled with an effort to achieve closure in practical affairs and personal relationships. Given that nothing could be done to prevent or retard aging, this focus made sense. Rather than fretting about the inevitable, one could aim for peace of mind. Today we face a different situation. While we still lack effective and acceptable means for slowing the aging process, we can identify research directions that might lead to the development of such means in the foreseeable future. “Deathist" stories and ideologies, which counsel passive acceptance, are no longer harmless sources of consolation. They are fatal barriers to urgently needed action.” *

### Read

* [The Fable of the Dragon Tyrant ](https://nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html)- Nick Bostrom. One of the most mind-changing pieces I've ever read. Explains why our attitude toward death is flawed. 

* [It Is Time To Classify Biological Aging as a Disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4471741/) - paper in Frontiers of Genetics explaining why aging is a disease, and why it is important that we classify it as such to increase funding and research for halting and reversing it.

* [Why Cryonics Makes Sense](https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html) - Tim Urban. Nice summary of why cryonics' difficult reputation is unwarranted and why one should probably sign up if one can afford it and wants to increase one’s chances of a long life.

* [The Prospect of Immortality ](http://www.cryonics.org/images/uploads/misc/Prospect_Book.pdf)- e-book by Robert Ettinger, "inventor" of cryonics.

* [Your Life in Weeks](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) - WBW post that breaks down a human life into weeks. You can buy this calendar on WBW, too. 

* [You're at the tail end of your life](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html) WBW post on how many of your favorite experiences you’ve had, and how many you will still have in your life-time: from parent-time, to swims in the ocean. We’re probably already at the tail end.

* [Genetics and Pharmacology of Aging: The Roadmap to Therapeutics for Healthy Aging](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281166476_Genetics_and_Pharmacology_of_Longevity_The_Road_to_Therapeutics_for_Healthy_Aging) - paper by Castillo-Quan, Kinghorn.  Paper summarizing effort in longevity research: As we move from genetics to pharmacology and therapeutics, studies will not only require demonstration of life-span extension and an underlying molecular mechanism, but also the translational relevance for human health and disease prevention. 

* [The Ageless Generation](https://books.google.com/books?id=5Ir7FCf_LWQC&pg=PA221&lpg=PA221&dq=ageless+generation+pdf&source=bl&ots=PIRWXAPx_d&sig=LlEKeBal98HRWto_0oxQiKdGt_w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjB1f3j5qvXAhVP2mMKHet-CY4Q6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&q=ageless%20generation%20pdf&f=false) - e-book by Alex Zhavoronkov. Provides a helicopter view on the progress science has already made, from repairing tissue damage to growing functional organs from a single cell, and illuminates the possibilities that the scientific and medical community will soon make into realities.

* [SENS](http://www.sens.org/) - SENS Research Foundation is a 501(c)(3) public charity that is transforming the way the world researches and treats age-related disease.The research we fund at universities around the world and at our own Research Center uses regenerative medicine to repair the damage underlying the diseases of aging. Our goal is to help build the industry that will cure these diseases.

* [Alcor: ](http://www.alcor.org/) The Alcor Life Extension Foundation is the world leader in cryonics, cryonics research, and cryonics technology. Cryonics is the science of using ultra-cold temperature to preserve human life with the intent of restoring good health when technology becomes available to do so. Alcor is a non-profit organization located in Scottsdale, Arizona, founded in 1972.

* [Brain Preservation Foundation](http://www.brainpreservation.org/) - In 2010 we established the Brain Preservation Foundation with an eye to this future perspective. We asked: "Is it possible to preserve the the synaptic connectivity of the human brain at death in a way that it could be stored for >100 years?" “How close is cryonics to meeting that goal?” “Are there alternative brain preservation methods stemming from modern neuroscience research?” We reasoned that one of the best ways to definitively answer these questions was to offer a [challenge prize](http://www.brainpreservation.org/tech-prize/): The Brain Preservation Prize: A challenge to cryonicists, a challenge to scientists

# The Brain

*"While some ems work in robotic bodies, most work and play in virtual reality. These virtual realities are of spectacular-quality, with no intense hunger, cold, heat, grime, physical illness, or pain; ems never need to clean, eat, take medicine, or have sex, although they may choose to do these anyway. Whether robotic or virtual, ems think and feel like humans; their world looks and feels to them much as ours looks and feels to us. Just as humans do, ems remember a past, are aware of a present, and anticipate a future. Ems can be happy or sad, eager or tired, fearful or hopeful, proud or shamed, creative or derivative, compassionate or cold." Robin Hanson*
