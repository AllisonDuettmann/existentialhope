Comment on above point forecasting civilization development from email thread on Long-term world improvement

"My points here are probably not very novel, but seem worth reiterating (since I feel like they are not given enough importance in the EA movement and its long term wing in particular).

The progress of civilization is not linear. Depending on the order in which scientific / technological breakthroughs are made, cultural and political factors and "luck", different long-terms outcomes seem possible. For example, we might or might not be killed by AGI, nuclear war, a synthetic pandemic or rogue nanotech. If AGI turns out to be very hard, we might see an era of upgraded humans which might or might not lead to extreme inequality or gradual loss of human essentials in a "race to the bottom." 

Speeding progress up seems much less useful than influencing the ultimate direction of progress, since the effect of the latter is multiplied by the enormous potential time-span of future human civilization (many billions of years at the least).

All this means that there is enormous value in (i) understanding the space of possible long-term outcomes (ii) understanding the factors influencing the probabilities of different outcomes and (iii) manipulating these factors to navigate towards better outcomes. However, it seems that all EA activity about this involves a few special cases which were semi-randomly singled out. The most prominent is AGI risk. Now, I do believe that AGI is very important (which is why I'm working on it as hard as I can), *maybe *it is even the most important factor as far as we know, but it shouldn't be the only thing on our radar. The large uncertainty about the future means we should be investigating many different scenarios.

In order to achieve i+ii we need to create tools for forecasting the development of civilization. The current state of social science seems inadequate for this purpose, and I think it is inadequate in ways that are unjustified. Specifically, what I want is quantitative models that produce probabilistic predictions. Before someone says "but it is impossible to predict something so complicated," I will point out that *probabilistic* prediction doesn't succeed or fail in a binary way: instead, we can have models that are quantitatively more or less accurate. It seems at least plausible that we can create models that are better than hand-waving and guessing, not necessarily in the sense that the model will always be better than human judgment, but in the sense that human judgment will be meaningfully informed by the model.

In order to create these models we need at least (i) a database of "training data" i.e. historical data about demographics, economics, genetics, epidemiology, legal systems et cetera, which is open access and continuously updated* (ii) tools for working with this data to evaluate models; in particular statistically sound evaluation criteria e.g. how well the model can compress the data and (iii) prediction markets where these models can be tested against "incoming" new data.

Ultimately, these models (together with human judgment) should be used to make a detailed analysis of various interventions. In the linear progress worldview speeding almost scientific / technological development is a net positive. In the branching progress worldview, I expect to have *roughly the same number of net positive and net negative things*. And I really want to know what these things are. Maybe curing cancer is bad because it increases the chance of a synthetic pandemic. Maybe quantum computers are bad because they increase the chance of UFAI. Maybe better 3D displays is good because of some reason nobody thought of because nobody has the entire causal diagram in their head. Right now, I feel almost nobody is asking these questions. Maybe it's because the questions are objectively too hard, but I feel that, for the most part, we're not really trying

* To demonstrate how the current state of affairs in this area is unjustifiably behind, note that it is hard even to find a good source of historical political maps. The best thing I managed to find (admittedly it was several years ago when I last tried) was [Euratlas](http://www.euratlas.com/), which only covers Europe and the time resolution is very poor (100 years). My friend's relatively simple pet project [History Ninja ](http://www.history.ninja/)seems already better than anything else found online."
