# Existential Angst

*"In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering in innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge. That was the haughtiest and most mendacious minute of "world history"- yet only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths the star grew cold, and the clever animals had to die." Nietzsche, On Truth and Lies*

* [The Myth of Sisyphus](https://ia801909.us.archive.org/15/items/AlbertCamusTheMythOfSisyphus/Albert%20Camus%20-%20The%20Myth%20Of%20Sisyphus.pdf) - e-book by Albert Camus. On the notion of the absurd and creating meaning in life. 

"Likewise and during every day of an unillustrious life, time carries us. But a moment always comes when we have to carry it. We live on the future: “tomorrow," “later on,” “when you have made your way,” “you will understand when you are old enough.” Such irrelevancies are wonderful, for, after all, it's a matter of dying. Yet a day comes when a man notices or says that he is thirty. Thus he asserts his youth. But simultaneously he situates himself in relation to time. He takes his place in it. He admits that he stands at a certain point on a curve that he acknowledges having to travel to its end. He belongs to time, and by the horror that seizes him, he recognizes his worst enemy. Tomorrow, he was longing for tomorrow, whereas everything in him ought to reject it. That revolt of the flesh is the absurd.” 

"I don't know whether this world has a meaning that transcends it. But I know that I cannot know that meaning and that it is impossible for me just now to know it."

* [The Absurd](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/The%20Absurd%20-%20Thomas%20Nagel.pdf) - Thomas Nagel. Answer to Camus' Myth of Sisyphus. While I don’t agree with it, here is an interesting conclusion

"If a sense of the absurd is a way of perceiving our true situation (even though the situation is not absurd until the perception arises), then what reason can we have to resent or escape it? Like the capacity for epistemological skepticism, it results from the ability to understand our human limitations. It need not be a matter for agony unless we make it so. Nor need it evoke a defiant contempt of fate that allows us to feel brave or proud. Such dramatics, even if carried on in private, betray a failure to appreciate the cosmic unimportance of the situation. If sub specie aeternitatis there is no reason to believe that anything matters, then that doesn't matter either, and we can approach our absurd lives with irony instead of heroism or despair. “

# Existential Hope

*We are all individual waves in the ongoing stream of human existence. Personally, we would like this stream to carry on and keep evolving infinitely into the future. In fact, we want to make it our explicit purpose. It may sound like a tall order but we believe that for a learning species nothing should be impossible. To keep the human project going as an infinite game, each generation needs to know the game we are playing and learn to play their round well. The Human Project*

* [The Human Project](https://www.amazon.com/HUMAN-Project-Erika-Ilves-ebook/dp/B00BPTIXVS) - by Erika Ilves, Anna Stillwell. Describes a very long-term vision for humanity in the cosmos, breaks down X-risks into human language, and finds human solutions

*Who are We? 13.7 billion years ago We were crammed into a single point. 10 billion years ago We were stars exploding into existence. 3 billion years ago We were bacteria. We were alive. 1,000 years ago We were all God's creations.  100 years ago We had proof We’re one species, descended from apes.  60 years ago We declared We’re all human, entitled to the same human rights. Today... We could tell a bigger story. We could create an identity that moves us. That takes us places. And…50 years from now We could be Martians. 1 billion years from now We could be Andromedans, living off new stars.  Until we eventually become  the creative force of our Universe. *

*We love life here every instant.  Every second is so good that it would blow your mind had its amperage not been previously increased.  My contemporaries and I bear witness, and we are requesting your aid.  Please, help us come into existence!  Please, join us!  Whether this tremendous possibility becomes a reality depends on your actions.  If your empathy can perceive at least the outlines of the vision I am describing, then your ingenuity will find a way to make it real.Human life, at its best, is fantastic.  I'm asking you to create something even greater.  Life that is truly humane.*

* [Existential Risk and Existential Hope](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Existential-risk-and-existential-hope.pdf) - paper by Owen Cotton-Barratt, Toby Ord. Introduces the term Existential Hope for the first time. 

*Just as we tend to talk about the existential risk rather than existential catastrophe, we want to be able to refer to the chance of an existential eucatastrophe; upside risk on a large scale. We could call such a chance an existential hope… The word 'eucatastrophe' is made of the Greek root ‘eu-’ meaning ‘good’ and the word ‘catastrophe’ in its classical sense of a sudden turn. It was coined by Tolkien to refer to the sudden and unexpected turn for the better frequently found at the end of fairy tales.*
