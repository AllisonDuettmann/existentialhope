* [Behave](https://www.amazon.com/Behave-Biology-Humans-Best-Worst/dp/1594205078) - book by Robert M Sapolsky.

A little old but still worth reading: articulates a gene's eye view of evolution - a view giving centre stage to these persistent units of information, and in which organisms can be seen as vehicles for their replication.
