# Please, please contribute! 

Everyone should have commenting rights - please comment on any doc about the many items that are missing. If you want credit for your input, mention it in the comment. 

If you see an item that you find inappropriate, please comment. If you'd like to start a focus group on a section, please message me and I'll give you editing rights. If you'd like to nominate someone to join a focus group, message me, too!

Thank you so much to everyone who is contributing already. I'm moved by your ideas and hopeful for the future of Existential Hope. I'm planning a follow-up salon to take stock of the progress soon and bought the domain [existentialhope.com](http://existentialhope.com) if the index warrants a website.

You're welcome to share this index with everyone who can derive value from it, or add value to it.

One ask: Don't be shy! 

A lot of people are reading the index continuously and that's the way it should be. But I am not an expert by far most of the topics and I need your help to populate these sections. Some sections, e.g. Environment & Energy are still blank, please change this! 

Much gratitude,

Allison Duettmann,
