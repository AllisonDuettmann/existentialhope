# Please, please contribute! 

You're welcome to share this index with everyone who can derive value from it, or add value to it.

One ask: Don't be shy!

A lot of people are reading the index continuously and that's the way it should be. But I am not an expert by far on any of the topics and I need your help to populate these sections. Some sections are still blank - please change this! 

If you'd like to add one of the many items that are missing. please speak up.

If you'd like to flag an item as inappropriate or unscientific, please speak up. 

If you'd like to become editor for one topic, please speak up. 

If you'd like to nominate someone to become go-to person for one section, please speak up.

If you'd like to help with the website (my skills are poor, as you can tell), please speak up.

If you have any other idea on how to spread existential hope, please speak up. 

You can do all of this via [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/RtY9BrFfSt77nRIs1) or contact me at a.duettmann@foresight.org

Thank you so much to everyone who is contributing already. I'm moved by your ideas and hopeful for the future of Existential Hope. I'm planning a follow-up salon to take stock of the progress soon. 


Much gratitude,
