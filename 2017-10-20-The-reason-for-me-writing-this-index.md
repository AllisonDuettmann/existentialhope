*With this index of Existential Hope **I want to do to Existential Risk, what Transhumanism did for my Existential Angst: Shifting the focus from fatalism to optimistic problem solving. *

**Existential Angst**

Since I can remember I have had a very strong dislike for death. Life is just so good.  

For a while I turned to philosophy in the hope to find reconciliation with death and the absurd attempt of giving meaning to my short life. I read nihilst, existentialist philosophers like Camus who writes on the meaninglessness of life:

*"Man stands face to face with the irrational. He feels within him his longing for happiness and for meaning. The absurdity of life is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world."  *

*[Albert Camu*s](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/957894.Albert_Camus)*, **[The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essay*s](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/855563)

Recommendations in these texts were usually along the lines of "Continue to live in the face of meaninglessness" or “accept the absurdity of life but live against it anyways”.

In all of these writings, death was seen as a given, the only changeable factor was one's attitude to it. 

**Transhumanism**

Luckily, via philosophy I eventually discovered individual transhumanist philosophy, and the idea that death is a disease, that can be overcome. Transhumanism doesn't resort to the depressing strategy of taking the catastrophe of death as given and urges one to lower one’s expectations, but rather constructively asks what it would mean to aspire to one’s expectations and not take death as given.

Take Nick Bostrom's Fable of The Dragon Tyrant: 

*"Stories about aging have traditionally focused on the need for graceful accommodation. The recommended solution to diminishing vigor and impending death was resignation coupled with an effort to achieve closure in practical affairs and personal relationships. Given that nothing could be done to prevent or retard aging, this focus made sense. Rather than fretting about the inevitable, one could aim for peace of mind. Today we face a different situation. While we still lack effective and acceptable means for slowing the aging process, we can identify research directions that might lead to the development of such means in the foreseeable future. “Deathist" stories and ideologies, which counsel passive acceptance, are no longer harmless sources of consolation. They are fatal barriers to urgently needed action.” *

*Nick Bostrom, The Fable of The Dragon Tyrant*

Thanks to writings like this my personal Existential Angst made way for an optimistic problem-solving attitude: 

Fatalistic recapitulation before death was swapped out for seeing death as arbitrary barrier to a potentially much grander life.  Seeing barriers as barriers allows one to take steps to move them away; For me this meant so far signing up to cryonics, and cryogenically preserving some of my stem cells. Calorie restriction doesn't work so well here in the US. 

Regardless of whether this will be successful or not, the attitude shift revealed another layer of the problem: 

**Existential Risk**

My personal existential angst about the meaning of my individual life and the rather selfish wish of prolonging it, is a puberty version of a more fundamental fear: The lack of meaning of all life in the universe, the potential annihilation of all of current life, and all those potential future beings, that might be so much more intelligent, interesting and complex than us.

As Nietzsche puts it:

 *"In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering in innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge. That was the haughtiest and most mendacious minute of "world history"- yet only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths the star grew cold, and the clever animals had to die. One might invent such a fable ans still not have illustrated how wretched, how shadowy and flighty the human intellect appears in nature. There have been eternities when it did not exist, and when it is done for again, nothing will have happened."* 

*Nietzsche, On Truth and Lies*

Given all current existential risks (risks that could wipe out any potential for a positive flourishing of humanity,) this future seems scarily likely: Risks from AI, and Biotech become ever more real, and even Nuclear risks are painfully being brought back onto the radar. 

Most research on Existential Risks is really quite sombering and makes one seriously doubt whether we'll make it through the century. 

But let's not succumb to this pessimist attitude. It is just like the approach to death that I used to have - so unliking of it but fatalistic toward changing it. Not seeing a way out, giving up, recapitulating, or reconciling oneself with it.

**Existential Hope**

Instead, we could do to X-risks, what transhumanist philosophy did to my fear of death - propagating optimism, turning it into a solvable problem and encouraging action in the right direction. 

We need optimistic visions for the future, rather than more Dooms Day scenarios and ironic descriptions of the dystopias we're racing toward. 

We need Existential Hope. 

Existential Hope are visions like this one: In this letter, Bostrom imagines a fictional being from a future Utopia writing to us to convince us to bring them into existence: 

*My consciousness is wide and deep, my life long.  I have read all your authors – and much more.  I have experienced life in many forms and from many angles: jungle and desert, gutter and palace, heath and suburban creek and city back alley.  I have sailed on the high seas of cultures, and swum, and dived.  Quite some marvelous edifice builds up over a million years by the efforts of homunculi.*

*But the whole exceeds the sum of its parts.  What I have is not merely more of what is available to you now.  it is also the complex relationships between these particulars that make up my mind.  There are ideas that can be formed only on top of such a wide experience base.  There are depths that can be fathomed only with such ideas. *

*We love life here every instant.  Every second is so good that it would blow your mind had its amperage not been previously increased.  My contemporaries and I bear witness, and we are requesting your aid.  Please, help us come into existence!  Please, join us!  Whether this tremendous possibility becomes a reality depends on your actions.  If your empathy can perceive at least the outlines of the vision I am describing, then your ingenuity will find a way to make it real.*

*Human life, at its best, is fantastic.  I'm asking you to create something even greater.  Life that is truly humane. *

*Nick Bostrom, Letter from Utopia*

This is just one of many possible positive visions. 

To collect others, I created an index of readings that inspire a positive long-term vision for humanity, one with existential hope. Because the list is for people who want to improve the world but don't know where to start, it also includes general readings on focus areas, and a toolkit to act. The difference is that the list begins with readings that lay out a vision of why we should care and where we might be if we overcome the existential problems that we’re all so worried about. The reading list focuses on Utopia, and why it’s neither impossible nor boring. 

The index is really just in its infancy. 

That's why I’m holding this salon tonight to get input on the list thus far and to push further.

The Index is divided into three parts:

* Vision: collects readings for positive futures. More inspirational. Answers: why should we care about a positive long-term future?

* Focus areas: zooms in on the main areas that will be important building blocks of a positive future

* Tools: focuses on meta-tools that individuals or collectives can use to change the focus areas to bring about the vision

**The objection to X-Hope that I came across most often: **

You may think: X-Hope optimizes for the wrong things. What about [Maxipok](http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.pdf)? I.e. rather than optimizing for utopias or eucatastrophes via X-Hope, we should aim for maximizing the probability of an OK outcome. 

Even if you think that Maxipok is true, for many people it is more motivational to act from positive incentives, to be for sth rather than against sth, to work toward a grand goal, rather than an okay outcome. Thus, a good strategy to achieve Maxipok might be to focus on X-Hope. 

I generally tend to think that much X-Risk literature puts the card before the horse in focusing solely on how catastrophic human extinction would be. It often misses to stress that extinction is only so bad, because the potential value that would be lost is so big, or even "astronomical"  in Bostrom's words. How much value would be lost? [According to a conservative estimate ](http://www.existential-risk.org/faq.html#2.)10^54 human-brain-emulation subjective life years, or 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 human-brain-emulation subjective life years.
