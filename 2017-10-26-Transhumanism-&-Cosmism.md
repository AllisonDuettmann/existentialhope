# Cosmism

*"Teetering here on the fulcrum of destiny stands our own bemused species. The future of the universe hinges on what we do next. If we take up the sacred fire, and stride forth into space as the torchbearers of Life, this universe will be aborning. Because of us, the barren dusts of a million billion worlds will coil up into the pulsing magic forms of animate matter. Slag will become soil, grass will sprout, and forests will spring up in once sterile places — a whole frozen universe will thaw and transmogrify, from howling desolation to blossoming paradise. Dust into Life; the very alchemy of God." Marshall Savage*
